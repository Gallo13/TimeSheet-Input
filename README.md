# TimeSheet-Input

Python GUI using wxpython, advanced wxpython, pandas and xlws to make and update excel files and fill out time sheets for hourly employees. Program will automatically add up total hours worked daily and then weekly once all information is completed. 

TimeSheet_Names.cvs not added to this since it includes people's names.

This is not complete and the actual writing to excel needs to be completed and the layout of the excel and input structure needs to be fixed and regulated.
